# Quotesso - Random Quote Machine

Quotesso is a simple and elegant web application that allows users to get inspired by random quotes with a single click. The app was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) and utilizes [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management. Each new quote comes with a refreshing color change to enhance the user experience, and users can easily tweet their favorite quotes directly from the app.
